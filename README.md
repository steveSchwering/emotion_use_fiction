# emotion_use_fiction
Analysis scripts for the study of how emotion category labels are used in spoken language and written language. The code contained in this repository only includes analysis scripts, excluding any participant data. The analysis scripts and data can be found on the Open Science Foundation repository list [here](https://osf.io/79tmf/).

In this project, we extracted all uses of emotion category labels from the spoken and written language corpora on the Corpus of Contemporary American English and rated them on whether the word was used in an emotive sense or not (e.g. "she felt pride in her actions" vs "the pride of lions attacked"). We found differences in how these labels were used across genres, with fiction texts using the words in an emotive way more often than spoken language:

Analyses generating this figure can be found in the file `emot_fic_corpus_analyses.Rmd`.

Then, we looked at whether people who read more were better able to recognize the emotions used in fiction more often than people who read less. Analyses of our results can be found in the files `experiment_1_analyses.Rmd` and `experiment_2_analyses.Rmd`.

You can find a write-up of those results [here in Affective Science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9382981/).

A continuation of this project looking at how emotion category labels are used in child-directed speech can be found [here](https://github.com/steveSchwering/emot_fic_child_corpus/tree/main) (we didn't find any differences, but I think there's some promise to look more!).
